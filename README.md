# Virtual_Memory_Simulator

This is a Virtual Machine (VM) Simulator which simulates the operation of a virtual
memory system. To launch the system, the simulator accepts one optional command-line
argument for the selection of  the page replacement algorithm. The system then accepts
commands to read/write from/to a virtual address space. The system correctly moves
pages between disk and main memory in order to satisfy access requests. The system
properly maintains the page table as part of this process.
